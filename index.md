Github is a great place to post code to share for others to use or learn from.

Over my long history of being a nerd, I've produced a large variety of code, and here are some of my favorites:

- [vgmdb.info](https://vgmdb.info/) ([source](https://github.com/hufman/vgmdb)) is an on-the-fly screenscraper for vgmdb.net, yielding data in JSON and RDF output formats. Screen scraping is fragile by its very nature, but it was a fun experiment.
- [Bimmer Gestalt](https://bimmergestalt.github.io/) is a project to reverse-engineer the BMW Connected Apps protocol and add new apps to the BMW IDrive system.
- [Chevy MyLink LCARS Theme](https://github.com/hufman/chevy_mylink_theming) replaces some of the menu graphics for the Chevy Spark EV with a LCARS-inspired layout. I'm particularly proud of my [custom-drawn wireframe ship](https://github.com/hufman/chevy_mylink_theming/blob/master/lcars/Bev/Battery%20Information/BEV_Powerflow_entry.svg).
